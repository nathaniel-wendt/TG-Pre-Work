var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;

// I learned that package.json has a projects dependencies listed to make it easy for other developers to install what they need to run your shiz.
